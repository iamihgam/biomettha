<p>We handled 10,000 samples by the end of March, 2020. A significant milestone for us in delivering a quality service while preserving the faith of our Customers that we built brick by brick over the last five years. By then, COVID had started spreading its tentacles in our region. Like any other small business in the world, we were also impacted drastically by COVID 19. Our orders reduced by almost 40% in the last year (YOY) due to overseas markets lockdown and reduced farming as a consequence. As much as we cherished splendid growth in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, we whole heartedly embrace these new challenges, constraints and difficulties especially when second wave is on rage in India now. We stand by our customers and consultants and support them in whatever ways we could possible. We strictly adhere to COVID guidelines while keeping our labs open and duly obliging to government regulations. Our prayers and best wishes for India and the World to recover from COVID.</p>
