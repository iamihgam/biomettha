Our primary concern is to satisfy -- chemistry, microbiology, molecular biology, and phycology -- needs of our farmers. Our labs are equipped with necessary instruments such as spectrophotometer, refractometer, microscope, ultra-centrifuge, thermocycler, and freezer in pursuit of our objectives. We also undertake research and developmental activities in quality control and sustainability.
